    Sir Timothy John "Tim" Berners-Lee OM KBE FRS (born 8 June 1955) is the inventor of the World Wide Web and he created a new computer language called HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) which most web pages are written in. The first web page was available on 6 August 1991.

Berners-Lee now leads the World Wide Web Consortium. That is an organization that looks after the World Wide Web. He is the author of the book Weaving the Web. He is a director of The Web Science Re
search Initiative (WSRI), and a member of the advisory board of the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence. In April 2009, he was elected as a member of the United States National Academy of Sciences, based in Washington, D.C. In 1999, Time Magazine named Berners-Lee one of the 100 Most Important People of the 20th Century.
 In March 2000 he was awarded an honorary degree from the Open University as Doctor of the university.
